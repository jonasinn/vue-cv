The application was deployed using Gitlab CI/CD."

Locally the system used an MQTT-based IoT message bus to gather data and control the wind tunnel which comprised of multiple Dockers applications controlling pieces of hardware, deployed using  deployed using Ansible. The local data was then transferred to the cloud (Google Cloud Platform - GCP), where we developed a full-stack web application (using a similar technologies as the performance simulation platform mentioned above) for data analysis and reporting."

After joining full-time, I was the sole person responsible for the project’s development. I upgraded the device to a custom PCB with an NRF52 microcontroller, incorporating BLE, ANT+ radios, GNSS positioning, and other sensors with a custom firmware. Later a second engineer joined the team and we further developed the firmware, data processing and a web-based post-processing platform. With an external partner we aimed to bring the device to market, but the project stopped after reaching the MVP stage."
